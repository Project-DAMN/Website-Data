               <p>Per the EPA issued guidelines, the AQI (also known as the Air Quality Index) is a numerical system used to communicate to the public how polluted
                  or how polutted the air is forecasted to be. The best analogy to make is to think of the AQI like the temperature on a thermometer. It's designed to 
                  inform the public the current air quality in a form that they can understand.
               </p>
               <br> <!-- this line break is just used to keep things pretty on the site-->
               <p>The AQI ranges on a scale  of 0-500, with 0 being the least amount of pollutants in the air, and 500 being absolutely deadly for nearly any living 
                  thing. On average, the range scores for the AQI are as follows:

               <p>On average, the Denton AQI hovers around the upper echelon of the the good air quality range to the middle of the moderate air quality range. 
                  This is all well and good, but it begs the question of how the AQI is calculated. The answer is slightly more complicated than you think. 
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>According to the EPA, the AQI is calculated based on the presence of six pollutants as categorized by the EPA as "critical pollutants". These 
                  are: Ozone, Particulate Matter 2.5, Total Reactive Nitrogen, Nitric Oxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, and Oxides of Nitrogen. The EPA monitors these pollutants 
                  and derives the AQI index based on the following formula:
               </p>
               <br>
			   <!-- This whole sentence is coded so that it can appear in the proper format on the webpage. It's a bit complicated, so just follow each bit carefully-->
               <p>I = ( (I<sub>high</sub> - I<sub>low</sub>) / C<sub>high</sub> - C<sub>low</sub>) ) (C - C<sub>low</sub>) + I<sub>low</sub> </p>
               <br>
               <p>It's OK if this is really confusing to you. It's a lot to take in, so let's break it down a bit. </p>
               <br>
               <p>The entire equation that you just read essentially dictates that the high's and low's, for a particular pollutant, and then average them against 
                  the Index's high's and low's in an attempt to average them out. From there, the AQI for each particular pollutant is averaged together and a daily 
                  AQI is derived from these numbers.

               <p>Open Denton/Denton Techmill is a group empowered to attain a better quality of living within the Denton area, and they hope to achieve that through 
			   the use of technological features. After having discovered that Denton, at the time of this project being conceived, only had one air monitor relaying 
			   data, the decision was made to create a system to better help inform and empower the Denton community over its air quality.
